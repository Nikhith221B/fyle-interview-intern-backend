# Note
You will have to do this assignment in a unix based system. If you have windows then make sure to use the `wsl` terminal as we have to use the command `bash run.sh` in this assignment



### Install requirements (Using virtualenv, Original documentation)


```
virtualenv env --python=python3.8
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### In my case this code was throwing error, so I created the environment named env using conda:
##### If You don't have conda installed in your system, then you have to execute following code to install miniconda for this assignment. If you already have conda installed in your system then you can skip this part
```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
After the installation is complete, you might need to close and reopen your terminal

Test the Installation:
Verify that Miniconda is installed correctly by running:
```
conda --version
```
This should display the installed Miniconda version.

Now, you have Miniconda installed on your Unix-based system, and you can use it to create and manage Python environments.


### Now making an environment with name `env` having python=3.8 using conda (Using conda to make env)
```
conda create --name env python=3.8
conda activate env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure every module is installed properly

### Reset DB

```
export FLASK_APP=core/server.py
rm core/store.sqlite3
flask db upgrade -d core/migrations/
```
### Start Server

```
bash run.sh
```
### Run Tests

```
pytest -vvv -s tests/

# for test coverage report
# pytest --cov
# open htmlcov/index.html
```

# Run by Docker compose
```
docker-compose up --build
```


# OR Build and Run with Docker:




## Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t <your-app-name> .
```


## Run the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 7755:7755 <your-app-name>
```

Now, your Flask application should be accessible at http://localhost:7755.
